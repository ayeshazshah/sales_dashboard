**📈 Sales Performance Dashboard ReadMe**


**Executive Summary**

This dashboard provides a comprehensive, up-to-the-minute look at our company's sales performance. The key objective is to quickly identify profit drivers, loss areas, and inventory trends across different product categories and sub-categories. With a total profit of $37K and 1,500 orders, this report helps us make smarter decisions to boost profitability.

**Business Problem**

The company needs a simple, visual tool to answer critical questions about its operational efficiency and product mix, specifically:

•	Which products are making money, and which are losing it?

•	Are there any significant seasonal trends or profit slumps we need to address?

•	Which cities are generating the highest profit?


**Skills Used**

This dashboard was built using a powerful set of tools and analytical techniques:

•	Data Analysis: Data cleaning, transformation, and structuring were performed on the raw sales figures to ensure accuracy.

•	Data Visualization: Power BI was used as the primary tool to create the interactive charts and metrics, allowing for easy filtering and data exploration.

•	Business Intelligence (BI): Key metrics like 'Sum of Profit' and 'Count of Order ID' were calculated and presented clearly to provide a true picture of business health.

**Results**

The analysis of the sales data reveals several key performance indicators:

•	Top Sub-Categories: Printers ($8.6K profit) and Bookcases ($6.5K profit) are the highest-profit sub-categories and major profit drivers.

•	Categories to Watch: While Clothing is the largest category by quantity (62.62%), Furniture contributes the highest percentage to profit (36.05%), indicating a higher profit margin.

•	Profit Loss Areas: We are currently losing money on Leggings, Skirts, Kurti, Electronic Goods, and Furnishings. These need immediate attention.

•	Seasonal Slump: The business experiences a clear period of loss from May to September, showing negative profit (the red bars) during the summer and early fall months.

•	Geographic Performance: Indore ($6.8K) and Pune ($6.2K) are our top-performing cities in terms of profit.


**Business Recommendations**

Based on these results, we recommend the following strategic actions:

1.	Stop the Bleeding: Immediately investigate the five sub-categories showing a loss (e.g., Leggings, Furnishings). This could involve clearing old inventory, discontinuing the product, or raising prices.
2.	Maximize High-Margin Items: Since Furniture drives the highest profit percentage, consider increasing marketing efforts for all Furniture sub-categories to capitalize on its high margin.
3.	Plan for the Slump: Develop a specific sales strategy for the May-September period. This could include major seasonal promotions, clearance events, or introducing high-demand seasonal items to counter the profit loss.
4.	Target High-Profit Cities: Focus additional marketing and logistical resources on Indore and Pune, as they are our most profitable markets.
